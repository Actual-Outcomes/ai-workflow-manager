description: Ensure tests reflect real implementations; no stubbed or demo-only suites.

# Real Tests Only

1. Every test (unit, integration, CLI, UI) must exercise actual implementation code. Do not create fake, stubbed, or demo-only tests that mask missing functionality.
2. If a feature is not implemented yet, do not add a passing placeholder test. Instead, write the test against the expected behavior and allow it to fail (marked as TODO) until the implementation exists.
3. The Test Console must only list suites that execute real tests. Remove any entries that simulate results.
4. Documentation should never reference tests or coverage that do not exist.
5. When adding a new suite, include instructions for reproducing failures and ensure CI can run it headlessly.

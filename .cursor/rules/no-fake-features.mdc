description: Require that all surfaced features correspond to real, working implementations.

# No Fake Features

1. Do not add placeholder, simulated, or non-functional features to the product UI, CLI, documentation, or tests. Every surfaced capability must be backed by working code.
2. If a feature cannot be delivered end-to-end, keep it out of the UI/CLI/UX entirely until it is complete. Avoid marketing or demo-only stubs.
3. When refactoring, remove any legacy simulated flows or demo data that could mislead users about actual functionality.
4. Tests exposed through the Test Console must execute real suites (vitest, integration, CLI). If a suite does not exist yet, omit the entry until it is implemented.
5. Before introducing a new entry point, confirm it is covered by automated tests or a documented manual verification plan.
